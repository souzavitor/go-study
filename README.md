# Simple Go Study

This my playground (or sandbox) for testing and learning Golang. Feel free to review and even make some suggestions.

## Features

For now this is a simple URL shortener powered by Golang and MongoDB. I like to use Docker but you are free to use whatever you'd like.

## Instalation

To run this simple app you will need to install [glide](https://glide.sh/) and run the command `glide install`.
You will also need to copy the file `.env.example` to `.env` and change the settings in the file.

Then run the command `go install` and then `$GOPATH/bin/go-study`.

In the future, we'll also be able to run `go test`. :)
